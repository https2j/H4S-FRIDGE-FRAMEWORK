  document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = "Despite being able to supply food to 7 billion people worldwide, we manage to throw away a third of the food we produce! In most highly developed countries, over half of all the food waste takes place in homes. In the UK, the average family's food waste is worth £730 per year, collectively adding up to £15 billion per year. 1.3 billion tons of food is wasted per year. This is more than enough to feed the 925 million people who are currently starving, and is worth £750 billion. This is the same as having an area as large as China which is used to grow food that is never eaten. Growing this wasted food also consumes 25% of the world's fresh water supply. If all of this food waste was a country, it would be the third highest emitter of greenhouse gases. So food wastage doesn't just deprive others of food, it also deprives them of water, and contributes largely to global warming. Even food wasted in Europe alone is enough to feed 200 million people and this is just getting worse as time goes on. ";

function myFunction2() {
  document.getElementById("demo1").innerHTML = "Saving food will help save lives, save money and lessen greenhouse gas emissions. How can you save food? 1).Shop Smart - Don't buy more food than you need. Most of it tends to spoil before you get a chance to eat it. 2). Organise your fridge to clearly see foods, and when they were bought (so you can more easily keep track of their expiry dates). 3). Store leftover meals in containers inside the fridge. 4). Make sure you eat healthy sized portions. Not just for aiding food wastage, but for your own health as well. 5). Don't be picky with how some food looks (fruit for example) as some people like to filter through fruits, picking the best looking ones. This has lead to a concerning number of supermarkets only purchasing perfect looking produce by farmers, leaving large amounts of food going to waste. All of which was fine to eat. 6). Blending food can make the absolute most out of it. Stems, peels and ends of produce may be unappealing to eat, however, blending them into a smoothie can make them a lot more tolerable.7). Another way to stop wasting food is simply putting a slice of cucumber or lemon in your glass of water. Not only will this help with not letting food to waste. It will also help with those who don't drink enough water by improving the flavour of it!  8). Better preserve food -- Vegetables: potatoes, tomatoes and cucumbers should not be refridgerated. They should instead be kept at room temperature. this prevents premature spoiling. Fruits: dry, ferment, pickle or can them."

function myFunction3() {
  document.getElementById("demo2").innerHTML = "Some food isn't wasted, it's simply lost instead. Something that most of us cannot control. Lost food refers to food that gets spilled, lost or incurs a reduction in quality during transportation. This typically occurs during production, harvest, post harvest, processing and distribution. "
