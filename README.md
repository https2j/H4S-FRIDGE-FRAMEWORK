# H4S-FRIDGE-FRAMEWORK

FAST FRIDGE FRAMEWORK - Team 8/ATE!! Themes: sustainability and revamping your life.

Prevents food waste, helps you keep track of items in your fridge and items you need to restock up on. You can add items to the fridge, set expiry dates, and remove them. You can also add items not in your fridge to a shopping list, which is interactive, so you can dynamically add, check off and remove items. There is also a calendar (not fully set up) that shows when items are expiring and when you are likely to restock on items (consumption rate theory). There is also a factsheet about food waste and how it can be prevented. :)
